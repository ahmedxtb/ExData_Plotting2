## Instructions

This repository contains six R scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) and the six png images generated by these scripts (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png).

When run each script generates the png image corresponding as long as the folder "exdata-data-NEI_data/" is in the working directory.
